      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I’m Simon Coelho. I live at the intersection of biotech, automation, and out-of-the-box creativity.
        Whether I’m tinkering with ROS2 or exploring new ways to streamline pharmaceutical processes,
        I’m always hunting for that next big breakthrough.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in pushing boundaries, questioning authority, and carving out a life that’s bigger than ordinary.
        Let’s revolutionize the future together—one experiment at a time.
